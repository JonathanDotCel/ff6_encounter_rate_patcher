# ff6_encounter_rate_patcher
Lowers the encounter rate in Final Fantasy 6, so you can enjoy the music, story, exploring, etc...

I got absolutely sick of every thread on "Can we fix the encounter rate a bit?" turning into
`"Oh you're such a noob"`
`"Games were just like this"`
`"Hah, you thought that was bad, you should try this..."`
`"Oh, try this other game instead."`
`"Hah you can walk TEN spaces? in <shitty old game> you can barely walk 3! And we loved it. 10 miles up and down a hill every day... and we had to suck it out of a damp newspaper"`

Ring any bells?

So here you go. It's much more enjoyable with fewer interruptions.
It's easier to remain focused on the story too.

## Windows:

Drag your .nes onto the .exe

## Linux & Mac OS

DotNET has native support from MS in Linux and Mac
Install dotnet 3.1 and run the .exe via that (you shouldn't need to recompile).
